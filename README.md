# React-Tac-Toe

This module is a Tic-Tac-Toe game played in the browser, completed as part of a [course](http://arch-joelross.rhcloud.com/) at the UW ISchool. 

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission!


##### 1. Does using a Model-View-Controller architecture make it easier to change your game in the future? How many places would you need to make changes to your code to make this a 5x5 game of Tic-Tac-Toe?
> The Model-View-Controller separates the parts so I find it extremely easy to change my game in the future. I would only have to change code in one line to make a 5x5 game of Tic-Tac-Toe.


##### 2. Why did I say that an `Array` is the best data structure to represent the game's grid of cells? Why not a 2D-array (Array of Arrays), or an Object, or a Linked-List, or a Tree? 
> All cells in the grid can be represented mathematically or calculated mathematically, so an array is a great way to represent it, as arrays have fast access to the elements inside. A 2D-array adds another level of unnecessary complexity to the data structure, as all arrays can be 2D-arrays with the proper math.


##### 3. What online resources did you find to help you learn React? How do you search for resources, and how did you determine whether they were helpful or not? Think back to the "learning an API" paper! 
> Stackoverflow and the react main page were the two most helpful resources for learning React. The React API documentation is surprisingly thorough, and while some names of the documentation might be misleading or hard to understand, their search optimization does a great job of automatically directing you towards those pages when you try to look to solve the problems through a search engine.


##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 8 hours


##### 5. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No


##### 6. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Maybe be a little clearer on your expectations of MVC
